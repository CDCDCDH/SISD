SHADOW AERIAL ANOTATION DATESET
data source:Building change detection dataset
Building change detection dataset:Our dataset covers an area where a 6.3-magnitude earthquake has occurred in February 2011 and rebuilt in the following years. This dataset consists of aerial images obtained in April 2012 that contains 12796 buildings in 20.5 km2 (16077 buildings in the same area in 2016 dataset). By manually selecting 30 GCPs on ground surface, the sub-dataset was geo-rectified to the aerial dataset with 1.6-pixel accuracy. This sub-dataset and the corresponding images from the original dataset are now openly provided along with building vector and raster maps.
